Project overview
This project demonstrates demonstrates how to secure access to Amazon S3 buckets. Here's a brief overview of the resources I used and how they contribute to securing S3 buckets:

Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3):

S3 is used as the primary storage service, which is highly scalable and durable. However, without proper security controls, sensitive data could be exposed. Securing access to the buckets is crucial for preventing unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data.
Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM):

IAM allows you to manage access to AWS services securely by creating users, groups, roles, and policies. You applied IAM policies to control who can access the S3 buckets and what actions they can perform, like read, write, or delete. Implementing least privilege principles is essential to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
IAM roles can also be used for cross-account access or assigning permissions to EC2 instances or other AWS services that interact with S3.
AWS CloudTrail:

CloudTrail logs every request made to your S3 buckets, which is invaluable for monitoring and auditing purposes. By tracking access to your buckets, you can quickly detect suspicious activity or unauthorized access. CloudTrail data can also be integrated with other services like Amazon CloudWatch for real-time monitoring and alerting.
